  <h1>My Name is Donnie Langston</h1>
  <p>I'm a dedicated cybersecurity student with a strong passion for protecting digital systems and looking forward to solving complex security challenges.
	 I'm currently pursuing my AAS in Cybersecurity at Wake Tech and look forward to learning in this fast-evolving field.  I find AI to be a fascinating and hope to
	 leverage it in my pursuit of becoming a security professional. I've spent most of my career in tech support working in biotech and in real estate.  I've had the opportunity to work hands on in many different 
	 IT settings but want to transition to security.  I look forward to the challenges ahead and hope to earn a few security certifications along the way. </p>
