     I'm currently pursuing my AAS in Cybersecurity at Wake Tech and look forward to learning in this fast-evolving field.  I find AI to be a fascinating and hope to
     leverage it in my pursuit of becoming a Cybersecurity professional.<br> 
     I've spent most of my career in tech support working in biotech and in real estate.  Starting out at New Horizon's I went through their 
     Systems & Infrastructure program where I learned Windows Desktop, Windows Server, CISCO networking and passed my CompTIA A+ and Net+ certifications. Since then I've had the opportunity to work hands on in many different 
     IT settings but want to transition to security where I'm most enthusiastic.  I look forward to the challenges ahead and hope to earn a few security certifications along the way.  </p>
